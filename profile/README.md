# About Kernel
After buying the Pixel 3, I didn't like the heat of the device, so I decided to build a custom kernel. This is how Angelic Kernel turned out

The following functions will be implemented in the kernel:
- Heating Fix
- EROFS support
- Increase in performance and battery life
- And there will also be an application for configuring kernel

and lots of other cool stuff!

# Supported Devices
Currently supported devices are Google Pixel 3/3 XL (Bluecross)
Later, maybe other devices will join the party!


There will be more information here later.
